# Assess .NET application using AppCAT tool

[![.github/workflows/test-action.yml](https://github.com/kpantos/dotnet-appcat-action/actions/workflows/test-action.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kpantos/dotnet-appcat-action/actions/workflows/test-action.yml)

This action uses the [Azure Migrate application and code assessment for .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/migrate/appcat/dotnet) CLI tool to assess .Net applications and upload the assesment report into your repository.

GitHub has data that is not represented in git â€” like Issues and PRs. The purpose of this action is to capture that data in a portable, usable fashion.

### Prerequisites
- The action requires a Windows based runner. Find out more on [Standard GitHub-hosted runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#standard-github-hosted-runners-for-public-repositories)

## Setup

Create an action! Copy the following into the action created:

```yaml
